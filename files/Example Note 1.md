# Structure of this Vault

This vault is designed to be **topic-centric** rather than folder-centric.

![[how I use Obsidian.png]]
## How to organize

1. **Files (`files/`)**: All your notes go here. No folders for "Project A" or "Idea B". Just flat files.
2. **Metadata**: Use the `topics` property to link your note to a subject.
    - Example: This note is linked to `[[ai]]`.
    - If you click `[[ai]]`, you will see a dashboard of all notes related to AI.

## How to create a new note

- Use `Cmd + N` (or your configured hotkey).
- The template will automatically add the frontmatter.
- Fill in the `topics`.
