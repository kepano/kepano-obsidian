# The Power of Linking

Because we use wikilinks `[[topic]]` instead of tags matching `#topic`, the graph view becomes much more meaningful.

- **Entity-First**: Topics are actual files (located in `references/`).
- **Renaming**: If you rename `[[ai]]` to `[[Artificial Intelligence]]`, all your notes update automatically.

## Bases and Views

Check `templates/bases/`. These are the "View Controllers". They define how lists of notes are displayed in the `references/` dashboards.
